### I am a 16 year old Content Creator who is using Github to explore HTML, CSS, JS and more!
I Welcome you to my Github Profile! I add random projects and stuff that I make here!
Some things I make here are serious, and some that I make aren't! :)

## Here are some repositories that I have made that are important to me! ❤️

### never alone/nvralone
As I mentioned, some of my projects focus on serious topics. This is (definitely) one of them.
never alone is a webpage dedicated to making hotline numbers and suicide prevention resources more accessible and faster to reach on slow connections.
<a href="https://nvralone.github.io/site/">Click me to visit the never alone webpage.</a>

<a href="https://github.com/nvralone">I also put this repository into an organization, because it just made more sense and it also helps people find it easier!</a>

### more to come soon?
