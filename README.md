### I am a 16 year old Content Creator who is using Github to explore HTML, CSS, JS and more!
I Welcome you to my Github Profile! I add random projects and stuff that I make here!
Some things I make here are serious, and some that I make aren't! :)

## Here are some repositories that I have made that are important to me! ❤️

### i hate it here.
As I mentioned, some of my projects focus on serious topics. This is (definitely) one of them.
i hate it here is a webpage created to make hotline numbers and suicide prevention resources more accessible.
<a href="https://github.com/ihith/ihih">Click me to visit the ihih webpage.</a>

<a href="https://github.com/ihith">I also put this repository into an organization, because it just made more sense and it also helps people find it easier!</a>
